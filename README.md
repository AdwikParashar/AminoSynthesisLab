# AminoSynthesisLab


This repository contains Python scripts for synthesizing and manipulating amino acids to create various compounds for neurotransmitter research. Using the RDKit library, the project simulates chemical reactions to generate and visualize molecules like neurotransmitters.

## Features

- Amino Acid Visualization: Create and save images of amino acids.
- Chemical Reactions: Apply various reactions (N-acetylation, O-methylation, decarboxylation, amidation, esterification, reductive amination) to amino acids.
- Molecule Generation: Generate images of resulting compounds for analysis and research.

### Usage

1. *Setup*: Ensure RDKit is installed in your Python environment.
2. *Run Scripts*: Execute the scripts in the scripts/ directory to generate molecule images.
3. *Results*: Find the generated images in the data/Â directory.
